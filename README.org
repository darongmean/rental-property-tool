*** The Levenshtein distance is the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one word into the other, so the result is a positive integer, sensitive to string length.
**** Which make it more difficult to draw pattern.
**** So from the Levenshtein algorithm point of view "Chien"/"Niche" are more similar than "ShazamIphone"/"ShazamAndroid" because fewer edits are needed to get from "chien" to "niche", than to get from "ShazamIphone" to "ShazamAndroid".
*** The limit of the Trigram method to compare strings is that short strings with one (or two..) different trigrams tend to produce a lower similarity than long ones.
*** Giving "more importance" to words with identical prefixes made the Jaro-Winkler distance seem very interesting for our use case.
** http://www.catalysoft.com/articles/StrikeAMatch.html
*** My algorithm rates the strings 'FRANCE' and 'REPUBLIC OF FRANCE' to have a good similarity of 56%.
*** On the other hand, the strings 'FRANCE' and 'QUEBEC' are seen to be reassuringly dissimilar, with a similarity of 0%.
*** 'FRENCH REPUBLIC' is more similar to 'REPUBLIC OF FRANCE' than it is to 'REPUBLIC OF CUBA' with similarities of 72% and 61%, respectively.
*** A reader of this article has pointed out that the algorithm I describe is the same as Dice's Coefficient, which I was not aware of at the time I rediscovered the algorithm or at the time that I wrote this article.

*** I do not recommend the Hamming distance for the majority of string-based information retrieval tasks.
** Comparing string similarity algorithms
We tested several algorithms to compare strings, and selected the one that would better fit our need. Jaro-Winkler seems to fit our need the most.

* Future Plan
** A property has more score if the property has more waypoints or closer to waypoints.
Waypoints are schools, work places, restaurants, transits etc...
** implement view endpoint
** implement suggest endpoint
** implement preview endpoint
** implement flyout endpoint
** implement match all columns

* WIP Scratch Notes
** DONE log request when no endpoints matched
** TODO implement reconcile against no particular data type
** DONE reconcile against the first column by default
** TODO remove debug-requests
** DONE setup base infrastructure code
** TODO use ngram for search
** TODO check how to remove low score result
** TODO remove comments from csv
** TODO write tests
** TODO use log instead of println
